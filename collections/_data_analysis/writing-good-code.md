# Using Git

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system useful for versioning textual data. This could be code or data for making a paper. Git is not so good at storing very large files or binary files as these can make the repository very large.

## Getting Git

Get git here: https://git-scm.com/

## Git glossary

One of the reasons people struggle to start with git is its terminology. Here is a short summary of the basic git commands.

These commands work in any directory:
* git init - start a new git repository in the current directory
* git clone "url" - Make a local copy of the git repository at "url"

Both of these initialise a git repository in the current directory by adding the hidden ".git" folder. This holds the git magic so donâ€™t change or delete anything in this folder.

These commands will work in an initialised git directory:
* git status - show the status of the current directory
* git log - show the log for recent commits in the repository
* git add "file_name" - add "file_name" to the staging area for the next commit
* git commit - Add the currently staged files as a commit
* git checkout "id" - Checkout the commit with commit id = "id"

These commands work when you have set up a remote:
* git pull - Incorporates changes from a remote repository into your local repository
* git push - Push any changes in the local repository to the remote

## Git GUIs

While you will occasionally need to use the command line to access advanced features, for the most part you can use a graphical interface.

* I would recommend GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/ for beginners who have not used git before and only want to use basic features. It is multiplatform, free and open source.
* For a more complete interface with nice branch visualisation I would recommend GitExtensions: https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions. Git extensions V3 is Windows only but V2 supports all platforms and is not that much older. It is free and open source.
* As an alternative GitKraken is really nice though it is proprietary and some features are subscriber only: https://www.gitkraken.com

## GitHub

GitHub is an online service for storing remote copies of repositories. While you can use git entirely as a local version control system, the advantage of having a remote repository is that you can synchronise your work over multiple computers and collaborate with others. We use a GitHub community to keep our groups code which you can access here: https://github.com/LightForm-group
