# Tutorial for beta reconstruction

## Cleaning data using Aztec Channel 5 and Aztec Crystal

[TODO]

## Running reconstruction.exe

The reconstruction.exe can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/LightForm-group/beta-reconstruction-archive/releases/tag/v1.1), this includes bug fixes of the source code to improve the file read speed and the size of maps that can be reconstructed.

Open the reconstruction.exe on any windows computer.

## Possible errors with beta reconstruction and how to solve them

## Beta reconstruction in Python

A python package to run the beta reconstruction is also available [here](https://github.com/LightForm-group/beta-reconstruction), which currently uses the existing functions of [DefDap](https://github.com/MechMicroMan/DefDAP). This python package will have a number of advantages compared with the executable - it is a lot faster, the statistics for the grain reconstruction can checked, and the results can be weighted by particular factors such as any indexed beta orientations recorded at room temperature.

## Beta reconstruction in MTEX

A beta reconstruction feature is also available in the latest version of MTEX, as explained in the documentation - [Parent Beta Phase Reconstruction in Titanium Alloys](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/TiBetaReconstruction.html).
