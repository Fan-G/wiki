# MTEX User Group

## Aim

The aim of the the MTEX User Group is to support anyone at Manchester who uses or will be using MTEX to analyse their EBSD, X-ray, Synchrotron or Neutron Diffraction data. We aim to do this by;

- **Supporting new users with more documentation and example code.** The documentation will be collated on this LightForm Wiki page. Example code will be included in the documentation, either written within the page, or as links to a GitHub repository.
- **Helping troubleshoot users problems.** This will be done in a meeting, which runs every month, to see if our user group can offer any solutions to solve the problem. We also have a Slack channel where users can post their issues for input from the entire group.
- **Keeping up-to-date with the latest methods for complex analyses.** Every month we will have a presentation from one of our users about how they are using MTEX to analyse their data, or to present a particular MTEX concept. This will provide the group with greater insight into the MTEX features. We also discuss what projects our users are currently working on to foster collaboration within the group.

The MTEX User Group meeting will be held once a month, with the aim to share our MTEX analysis in a relaxed and informal environment. We will give an opportunity to discuss any problems that people are having with MTEX and for members to help each other out.
