## UNIX interface

The terminal is a very powerful interface based in the UNIX language with which you can do everything you could usually do using a mouse cursor and windows. Using a variety of commands,  directories and files can be created, moved and copied. Programs can be installed, ran and debugged from the command line. Here is where you can start to appreciate the utility of typing commands over clicking and dragging icons.

## On MAC

To access the terminal on mac, go to launchpad, and search 'Terminal'. opening this will bring up a black window with some lines of code. Lets walk you through it:
```bash
Last login: Fri Mar 12 10:38:17 on ttys002
Y15576GB@C-LOSX1EVL410 ~ % <TYPE A COMMAND HERE>
```
This is my terminal. The first line is telling me the date and time of my last login, while the second line is telling me the user (Y15576GB) and the machine (LOSX1EVL410). Here ill use greater/less than parenthesis `(<>)` to indicate where you could type a command.
