## LightForm email distribution lists

We currently operate three listserve email distribution lists:

<table class="vertical-header smaller">
  <tr>
      <th><code>LIGHTFORM-PDRAS-PHDS</code></th>
      <td>PDRA team and PhD students</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <th><code>LIGHTFORM-PHDS</code></th>
      <td>PhD students</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <th><code>MASS-PHD-PDRA</code></th>
      <td>All people associated with LightForm: Masters students, PhD students, PDRA team, management team.</td>
  </tr>  
</table>

To add a new LightForm member to a given emailing list, follow these steps (you must be a list owner):

1. Go to [https://listserv.manchester.ac.uk/](https://listserv.manchester.ac.uk/)
2. Click on `List Owner Dashboard`
3. Go to `Subscriber Management`: ![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/posts/new_starter_listserv_1.png)
4. Select the list to which the new starter should be added: ![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/posts/new_starter_listserv_2.png)
5. Type the new starter's email address and click the `Add to...` button: ![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/posts/new_starter_listserv_3.png)

Note: I used the information [here](https://kb.iu.edu/d/alml) to set the access levels of the lists. They are currently set so any subscriber may send an email to the respective distribution list (using the `Send= Private,Confirm` setting).

## LightForm website

Add the new starter to the [people section](https://lightform.org.uk/people) of the LightForm public website.


## Wiki data file

Add the new starter to the `people.yml` data file on the Wiki, which resides [here](https://github.com/LightForm-group/wiki/blob/master/_data/people.yml).

## Dropbox

Add the new starter to the each of the three theme meeting folders on Dropbox.
