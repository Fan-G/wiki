### Must read documentation

It is important that you read the School Safety Policy. Management System and Safety Personnel documents can be found on the School intranet [here](https://www.staffnet.manchester.ac.uk/materials/health-and-safety/).

In addition, you must read the University safety policy which can be found [here](http://documents.manchester.ac.uk/DocuInfo.aspx?DocID=654).

### Mandatory training

You must attend the Health and Safety Induction and any specialised local safety training specified by your supervisor or the health and safety staff. 

There is detailed information in the Management System document ([here](https://www.staffnet.manchester.ac.uk/materials/health-and-safety/forms/)) on the how to carry out Risk and COSHH assessments for laboratory based work. You need to update/revise your Risk and COSHH assessment forms annually when your work changes.

**Please note: No work can commence until a risk assessment and or COSHH has been completed.

You must familiarise yourself with your laboratories and pay attention to all the safety documents relating to those areas. Safety equipment such as safety glasses, laboratory coats, gloves and hard hats will be issued as required and must be worn. 

For Postgraduate Students there are also Compulsory Health & Safety assessments on eProg.

The School safety policy and templates for risk assessments are available on the Virtual Common Room.

If you have any questions regarding health and safety, please contact your supervisor or the School Safety Advisor as detailed above.

### Keeping our team safe

We are committed to the implementation and maintenance of the highest standards of health, safety and welfare and we all have an important role in maintaining a healthy and safe environment.

Whilst on University business, it is your responsibility to take reasonable care of your own and others' safety by adopting safe working practices and making proper use of the safety facilities provided.

You can do this by complying with University Health and Safety Policies and Codes of Practice, which cover activities conducted within, or on behalf of the University. This applies not only on University premises, but anywhere else that you may be working.

We all have a duty of care in the workplace, therefore if you see anything that may be a health and safety breach and is likely to cause harm, you must speak up and report it to the appropriate health and safety officials immediately.
