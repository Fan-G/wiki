Slack

The LightForm communications hub is Slack, a single place for messaging, tools and files – helping everyone save time and collaborate together.

Within SLACK we have a channel for every conversation, themes, conferences, website etc.

As a SLACK members you can join and leave channels as and when they need to – unlike with lengthy email chains, threads keep side conversations from derailing the topic or project at hand.

SLACK enables Face-to-face and face-to-screen, you can talk in depth over voice or video calls directly from Slack, if you need to show your work, you can also share your screen.

If you have not yet signed up to SLACK, please contact Natalie Shannon Natalie.A.Shannon@manchester.ac.uk for an invitation to join.
