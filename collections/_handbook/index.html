<p>This handbook gives insight into the structures and practices of the LightForm project and is designed for use by all LightForm colleagues and associates. Its purpose is to provide practical guidance regarding University policies and LightForm specific information and procedures. It aims to make it easier for colleagues to understand how we work, join and engage with the LightForm community.</p>

<h3 id="about-this-handbook">About this handbook</h3>
<p>The LightForm handbook is a living document, that means that it won't ever be complete, and our aim is for it to change and develop over time, with your input. So, if you see something that is missing or could be improved, you can contribute.</p>

<h3 id="structure">Structure</h3>
<p>Our handbook contains LightForm's most "static" knowledge and information; it's a quick guide on "how to" for the administration aspects of LightForm, for example how to arrange payment for a conference or hotel. Importantly, it also defines how we operate, for example best practice lab procedures, safety and risk assessment.</p> 

<h3 id="contributing-to-this-handbook">Contributing to this handbook</h3>
<p>The LightForm handbook can only be useful if it is a living document, which is taken care of by the LightForm community and fed with regular updates. Like the rest of the LightForm Wiki, this handbook can easily be modified and maintained as a dynamic document. As a LightForm colleague, this is your handbook, so we encourage you to contribute. We look forward to your suggestions & contributions.</p>
<p>If you want to contribute to the handbook (or to anywhere else on the Wiki), please give <a href="/wiki/miscellaneous/contribution">this short guide</a> a quick read.</p>
<p>When editing the handbook in particular, please be mindful of the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If possible, respect the existing structure of the handbook when making changes</li>
    <li>Co-ordinate with the LightForm Project Manager before making <i>large</i> changes to existing parts, such as restructuring or deleting sections.</li>
    <li>Let Natalie know after you have created a new section!</li>
</ul>
