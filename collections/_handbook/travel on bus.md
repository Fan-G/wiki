If you are travelling on University business, you are responsible for familiarising yourself with any potential travel risks and ensuring you have travel insurance.

### Risk Assessment 

The University have recently introduced a policy for all colleagues travelling on University business to familiarise themselves with potential travel risks and to register with the School of Materials H&S.

Full details regarding a risk assessment/pre-travel self checklist and general travel advice can be found https://www.staffnet.manchester.ac.uk/insurance/travel/ 

To register University business travel, please contact <christopher.turnbull@manchester.ac.uk>
          
### Travel Insurance 

Full details of University travel insurance can be found https://www.staffnet.manchester.ac.uk/insurance/travel/  

Please note you will only be covered by University travel insurance for the duration of University business. If you are arriving earlier/staying later for leisure purposes, you will need to provide your own personal travel insurance.
