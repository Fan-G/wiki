The LightForm Code of Conduct is applicable to the entire LightForm team. It defines how we operate, how we work together and how we treat one another, in order to foster an inclusive work environment, in which to successfully deliver our project goals.

It sets out standards of practice which the team are expected to follow when within, or representing LightForm.  

This code is not exhaustive, and it is important that individuals seek advice and guidance if necessary. 

All team members will be briefed, in addition, the induction programme for all new colleagues will reinforce the principles of this code. 


### Our work space

Our work space is one which encourages inclusive participation and does not tolerate discrimination or harassment.

Discrimination and harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of discussions, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

We will work in an environment where challenging negative behaviour is the norm and those who challenge will be supported at a senior level.
A colleagues position or status will not deter others from addressing their behaviour. 

Harassment and discrimination by and/or of members of our team will not be tolerated in any form. 

If you have concerns regarding colleague conduct, you can choose to discuss these with LightForm Project Manager or a colleague external to LightForm:

**LightForm Project Manager**
We are currently without a project manager. During this period, João Fonseca will be trying to keep up with project management duties. This is not ideal, and we hope to have a new project manager very soon.

### Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Policy 

The University of Manchester is committed to promoting equality and providing an environment where all members of its community are treated with respect and dignity. We are committed to seeking to employ a workforce and educate a student body that reflects the diverse community we serve. The Equality Act (2010) helps by providing a legal framework to protect people from discrimination, harassment and victimisation in the workplace and wider society. http://documents.manchester.ac.uk/display.aspx?DocID=8361

Any staff member or student who believes that they may have been the victim of discrimination, harassment, bullying or victimisation shall have protection under the University’s Dignity at Work and Study Policy and Procedure.

### How we communicate and support one another

Effective methods of communication create a happier work environment at all levels and support all team members to feel valued and acknowledged.

To successfully communicate with and support one another we will:

-	Be mindful of the positive impact of something as simple as greeting and thanking colleagues (good morning/ hello) has on the mood of the working environment
-	Foster a supportive team culture of sharing ideas and helping each other, promoting feedback, candid open discussion, critical reflection and continually incorporate it into next stage/meeting
-	Recognise that mistakes are an opportunity to learn and develop
-	Operate a safe working environment where we listen to, and respect others 
-	Hold regular One to One meetings and regular team meetings, which we prioritise our attendance at 
-	Make time for and engage with team socials/away days/lunches, recognising the importance of connecting with colleagues outside of the work space
-	Consider the thoughts and expectations of others by asking for and paying attention to feedback from colleagues
-	Be empathic, compassionate and considerate while remaining professional

### How we operate as a team

By working in a planned and measured way, we can deliver positive, timely outcomes. 

We will therefore:  

-	Have task based meetings and clear project timelines
-	Have a schedule of meetings set up in advance
-	Set clear objectives with realistic deadlines, sharing progress and outputs via weekly group progress meetings, updating spreadsheet summary and meeting notes for Dropbox
-	Attend required progress meetings, inform colleagues if you are unable to attend with sufficient notice, and promptly complete any outstanding actions resulting from non-attendance
-	Achieve tasks within deadline
-	Plan in advance to give people warning about activities and time to achieve the task
-	Discuss and agree priorities and time table
-	Forecast  what will be needed in the future
-	Proactively share resources, information and expertise, 
-	Share resources, information and expertise by utilising SLACK as an essential, inclusive group communication tool  

### Publications and authorship

LightForm is collaborative research group, built on the idea that if we all help each other, we can all do better work, faster. As a consequence, many people will often contribute to our research outputs like data, software and publications. Therefore, it is important that authorship is considered carefully before publication, and that all contributions are appropriately acknowledged. At the very least, authorship should be discussed explicitly with all researchers involved, including PhD students, MSc and UG students, PDRAs, experimental officers and technicians. This does not mean that helping with research automatically implies authorship on a paper. In many cases a mention in the acknowledgements section will suffice. Nevertheless, authorship should be discussed before publication, so as to avoid any misunderstandings and to avoid missing out anyone's contribution. If agreement cannot be reached, arbitration should be sought via the project manager.

### Working hours

Core campus working hours are 10am to 4.00pm Monday to Friday in order to facilitate collaborative working. Meetings and events will not be arranged outside these hours. 
Exceptions for these core hours can be arranged in line with University and Departmental policy.

Avoid sending work-related email outside of 8.00am and 6.00pm, colleagues are not required, or should feel obliged to reply to emails outside of their typical work hours.

On occasions when you need to send emails outside of working hours, you may consider adding the following:

> While I may be sending this email outside my normal office hours, I have no expectation to receive a reply outside yours.

### Working from home

On occasions when a work from home arrangement is necessary, please inform in advance your Line Manager/Supervisor as campus based working is encouraged for the purpose of team collaborations. Remember to set up a status update for email/SLACK if there will be a delay in you responding to colleagues.

### Work - life balance

Domestic and family responsibilities have shifted over the years. LightForm working practices are supportive of work-life balance and can accommodate flexible days including work from home days to flexible hours, in order to fit real life commitments of parents, carers and the unforeseen life circumstances, which we all require space to deal with on occasion.
If you would like to discuss flexible working arrangements, please speak with your Line Manager. 


### Booking Leave

Leave requests must to be forwarded to your Line Manager/Supervisor for prior approval. Please consider work schedules and commitments when planning leave.
