Sometimes analysis of images can be useful in order to quantify aspects of the image, perhaps measuring a certain structure or identifying the position of a certain structure to include or exclude it in another analysis.

The skimage library in Python contains many useful functions for image analysis.

Example analysis scripts are linked on the main experiments wiki page.
